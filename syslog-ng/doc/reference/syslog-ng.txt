1. Timezone handling

One of the most neglected area of Unix is handling system events. Daily checks
for system messages is crucial for the security and health conditions of a
computer system.

System logs contain much "noise" - messages having no importance - and
important events which should not be lost in the tide of messages. With the
current tools it is difficult to select which messages are interesting.

A message is sent to different destinations based on the assigned facility/
priority pair. There are 12+8 (12 real and 8 local) predefined facilities
(mail, news, auth etc.), and 8 priorities (ranging from alert to debug).

One problem is that there are facilities which are too general (e.g.: daemon),
and are used by many programs, even if they do not relate each other. It is
difficult to find the interesting bits from the enormous amount of messages.

A second problem is that there are very few programs which allow setting their
"facility code" to use for logging. It is at best a compile time parameter.

Consequently, using facilities as a means of filtering is not an optimal
approach. A better solution would be to make the syslog facility a runtime
option for all applications, and add the ability to create new facilities in
syslogd. Neither of these are available; the first one is not even feasible.

One of the design principles of syslog-ng was to make message filtering much
more finegrained. syslog-ng is able to filter messages based on the contents of
messages in addition to the priority/facility pair. This way only the really
important messages are sent to a specific destination. Another design principle
was to make log forwarding between firewalled segments easier using long
hostname format, which makes it easy to find the originating and the chain of
forwarding hosts - even if a log message traverses several computers. The last
principle was a clean and powerful configuration file format.

1. Timezone handling

One of the new features of syslog-ng 2.0 is the support for messages
originating from different timezones. This is a difficult problem, as the
original syslog protocol does not include timezone information. syslog-ng
provides a solution by extending the syslog protocol to include this
information and also by giving finegrained control to the administrator to
supply timezone information for legacy devices which do not support the
protocol extension.

Timezone information is associated with messages entering syslog-ng using the
following algorithm:

 1. The sender can specify the timezone of the messages. If the incoming
    message includes a timezone it is associated with the message. Otherwise,
    the local timezone is assumed.

 2. The administrator specifies the time_zone() parameter for the source driver
    that reads the message. This parameter overrides the original timezone of
    the message. Each source defaults to the value of the recv_time_zone() 
    global option.

 3. The destination driver specifies the timezone via the timezone() parameter.
    Each destination driver might have an associated timezone value to which
    message timestamps are converted before they are sent to the final
    destination (file or network socket). Each destination defaults to the
    value of the send_time_zone() global option. A message can be sent to
    multiple destination zones.

 4. When macro expansions are used in the destination filenames, the local
    timezone is used.

There is another case when message timestamps are formatted:

6. Options

In syslog-ng a message path (or message route) consist of one or more sources,
one or more filtering rules and one or more destinations. A message is entered
to syslog-ng in one of its sources, if that message matches the filtering rules
it is sent to the specified destinations. Note that a message goes to all
matching destinations by default, although this behavior can be changed.

1. Sources

A source is a set of source drivers collecting messages using a given method.
For instance, there is a source driver for AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM style sockets,
used by the Linux syslog() call.

To declare a source, the source statement has to be used in the configuration
file with the following syntax:

                                        source <identifier> { source-driver(params); source-driver(params); ... };


The identifier has to uniquely identify the given source, and may not clash
with any of the reserved words (in case of a name clash, simply enclose the
identifier in quotation marks).

You can control exactly which drivers are used to gather log messages, thus you
have to know how your system and its native syslogd communicate. Below is an
introduction to the inner workings of syslogd on some of the tested platforms:

Table 2.1. Communication method between syslogd and its clients

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Platform |                              Method                              |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          |A SOCK_STREAM unix socket named /dev/log; some of the             |
|Linux     |distributions layers switched over to using SOCK_DGRAM, though    |
|          |applications still work with either method.                       |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
|BSD       |A SOCK_DGRAM unix socket named /var/run/log.                      |
|flavors   |                                                                  |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Solaris   |                                                                  |
|(2.5 or   |An SVR4 style STREAMS device named /dev/log.                      |
|below)    |                                                                  |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Solaris   |In addition to the STREAMS device used in earlier versions, 2.6   |
|(2.6 or   |uses a new multithreaded IPC method called door. By default the   |
|above)    |door used by syslogd is /etc/.syslog_door.                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Each possible communication mechanism has the corresponding source driver in
syslog-ng. For instance, to open a unix socket with SOCK_DGRAM style
communication use the driver unix-dgram, the same with SOCK_STREAM style - as
used under Linux - is called unix-stream.

Example 2.1. Source statement on a Linux based operating system

                                        source src { unix-stream("/dev/log"); internal(); udp(ip(0.0.0.0) port(514)); };


Each driver may take parameters; some of them are required, others are
optional. The required parameters are positional, meaning that they must be
specified in a defined order. A unix-stream() driver has a single required
argument, the name of the socket to listen to, and several optional parameters,
which follow the socket name. Optional arguments can be specified in any order
using the option(value) syntax.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

For a complete descriptions on the above drivers, see Section 1, ?Source
drivers?.

2. Filters

Filters perform log routing within syslog-ng. You can write a boolean
expression using internal functions: a message passes if the expression is
true.

Filters also have a unique identifying name that can be referenced in log
statements.

Syntax for the filter statement:

                                filter <identifier> { expression; };


An expression may contain parentheses, the boolean operators "and", "or" and
"not", and any of the functions listed in Table 3.10, ?Available filter
functions in syslog-ng?.

Example 2.2. A filter statement finding the messages containing the word 'deny'
coming from the host 'foo'

                                        filter f_blurp_deny { host("foo") and match("deny"); };


For a complete description on the above functions, see Section 3, ?Filter
functions?.

In earlier revisions of syslog-ng there was a special filter identifier,
"DEFAULT", which matched all not-yet-matched messages. This could make your
configuration much simpler and easier to manage. This feature was removed in
syslog-ng 1.5.x, and a more powerful idea was introduced. For more details
consult Section 5, ?Log paths?.

3. Destinations

A destination is where a log is sent if the filtering rules match. Similarly to
sources, destinations are comprised of one or more drivers, each defining how
messages are handled. Destinations can be declared in the configuration file
via a destination statement using the syntax below:

                                        destination <identifier> { destination-driver(params); destination-driver(params); ... };


Note

The list of drivers may be empty: in this case all messages sent to the
destination are discarded. This is equivalent to omitting the destination from
the log statement.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   Name    |                           Description                           |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|

|()         |(Linux).                                                         |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|

|()         |(BSD).                                                           |

|           |its standard input.                                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

For detailed description of the supported drivers, see Section 2, ?Destination
drivers?.

4. Template objects

syslog-ng 2.0 allows you to define common templates, and refer to them from
every object requiring a template. For example:

          template t_filetmpl { template("$ISODATE $HOST $MSG\n"); template_escape(no)); };

          destination d_file { file("/var/log/messages" template(t_filetmpl); };


Templates can reference one or more macros as described in Section 4, ?Macros?.

Note

Previous versions of syslog-ng required template formats to be defined for
every destination.

5. Log paths

The previous chapters described how to define sources, filters and
destinations. These components have to be connected together using log
statements. The syntax of log statements is described below:

                                log { source(s1); source(s2); ...
                                filter(f1); filter(f2); ...
                                destination(d1); destination(d2); ...
                                flags(flag1[, flag2...]); };


Any message coming from any of the listed sources, matching all the filters is
sent to all listed destinations. Log statements are processed in the order they
appear in the configuration file.

By default, all matching log statements are processed, therefore a single log
message might be sent to the same destination several times, provided the
destination is listed in several log statements.

This default behavior can be changed using the flags() parameter.

Table 2.4. Log statement flags

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|    Flag    |                          Description                           |
|------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
|            |This flag means that the processing of log statements ends here.|
|final       |Note that this does not necessarily mean that matching messages |
|            |will be stored only once, as there can be matching log          |
|            |statements processed prior the current one.                     |
|------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
|            |This flag makes a log statement 'fallback'. Being a fallback    |
|fallback    |statement means that only messages not matching any             |
|            |'non-fallback' log statements will be dispatched.               |
|------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
|catchall    |This flag means that the source of the message is ignored, only |
|            |the filters are taken into account when matching messages.      |
|------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
|            |Specifies that this log path should be flow controlled, meaning |
|            |that syslog-ng will stop reading messages from sources feeding  |
|            |destinations through this log statement if the destinations are |
|flow-control|not able to process the messages at the required speed. If      |
|            |disabled, syslog-ng will drop messages if the destination queues|
|            |are full. If enabled, syslog-ng will only drop messages if the  |
|            |destination queues/window sizes are improperly sized.           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

6. Options

There are several options that can modify the behavior of syslog-ng. For an
exact list of possible options see Section 5, ?Options?. Each option may have
parameters, similarly to driver specifications. The general syntax is:

                                options { option1(params); option2(params); ... };

1. Source drivers

The following drivers may be used in source statements, as described in
Section 1, ?Sources?. The option log_msg_size() is available in each source: it
specifies the maximum length of incoming log messages in bytes. If not
specified, the value of the global option is used (see Section 5, ?Options?).

Some parameters affecting message parsing are common for all sources:

1.1. internal()

All internally generated messages "come" from this special source. To collect
warnings, errors and notices from syslog-ng itself, include this source in one
of your source statements.

                                        Declaration: internal()


syslog-ng will issue a warning upon startup if this driver is not referenced.

Example 3.1. Using the internal() driver

                                                source s_local { internal(); };


1.2. unix-stream() and unix-dgram()

These two drivers behave similarly: they open the given AF_UNIX socket and
start listening on it for messages. unix-stream() is primarily used on Linux
and uses SOCK_STREAM semantics (connection oriented, no messages are lost);
while unix-dgram() is used on BSDs and uses SOCK_DGRAM semantics: this may
result in lost local messages if the system is overloaded.

To avoid denial of service attacks when using connection-oriented protocols,
the number of simultaneously accepted connections should be limited. This can
be achieved using the max-connections() parameter. The default value of this
parameter is quite strict, you might have to increase it on a busy system.

Both unix-stream and unix-dgram have a single required positional argument,
specifying the filename of the socket to create, and several optional
parameters.

Note

syslogd on Linux originally used SOCK_STREAM sockets but this was changed in
some distributions to SOCK_DGRAM at around 1999. The change was a fix to a
possible DoS problem, however, this might not have been a proper solution. On
Linux you can choose to use whichever driver you like as syslog clients
automatically detect the socket type being used.

                                                Declaration:
                                                unix-stream(filename [options]);
                                                unix-dgram(filename [options]);


The following options can be specified for these divers:

Example 3.2. Using the unix-stream() and unix-dgram() drivers

                                                # source declaration on Linux
                                                source s_stream { unix-stream("/dev/log" max-connections(10)); };

                                                # source declaration on BSD
                                                source s_dgram { unix-dgram("/var/run/log"); };


1.3. tcp(), tcp6(), udp() and udp6()

These drivers enable to receive messages from the network. As the name of the
drivers implies, both UDP and TCP can be used to transport messages. The tcp6()
and udp6() use the IPv6 network protocol.

UDP is a simple datagram oriented protocol, which provides "best effort
service" to transfer messages between hosts. It may lose messages, and no
attempt is made at the protocol level to retransmit such lost messages. The
syslog protocol traditionally uses UDP.

TCP provides connection-oriented service, which basically means a
flow-controlled message pipeline. In this pipeline each message is
acknowledged, and retransmission is done for lost packets. Generally it is
safer to use TCP, because lost connections can be detected, and no messages get
lost, assuming that the TCP connection does not break. When a TCP connection is
broken the 'in-transit' messages that were sent by syslog-ng but not yet
received on the other side are lost. (Basically these messages are still
sitting in the socket buffer of the sending host and syslog-ng has no
information about the fate of these messages).

The tcp() and udp() drivers do not require any positional parameters. By
default they bind to 0.0.0.0:514, which means that syslog-ng will listen on all
available interfaces, port 514. To limit accepted connections to only one
interface, use the localip() parameter as described below.

Note

The tcp port 514 is reserved for use with rshell, so select a different port if
syslog-ng and rshell is used at the same time.

If you specify a multicast bind address to udp() and udp6(), syslog-ng will
automatically join the necessary multicast group. TCP does not support
multicasting.

                                        Declaration:
                                        tcp([options]);
                                        udp([options]);

Example 3.3. Using the udp() and tcp() drivers

                                                source s_tcp { tcp(ip(127.0.0.1) port(1999) max-connections(10)); };
                                                source s_udp { udp(); };


1.4. file()

Usually the kernel presents its messages in a special file (/dev/kmsg on BSDs,
/proc/kmsg on Linux), so to read such special files the file() driver is
needed. Please note that this driver cannot follow a file like tail -f does. To
feed a growing logfile into syslog-ng (e.g.: an HTTP access.log), use a script
like this:

Example 3.4. Script to feed a growing logfile into syslog-ng

                                                #!/bin/sh
                                                tail -f logfile | logger -p local4.info


The file driver has a single required parameter specifying the file to open,
and has only the common source specific options as specified in Table 3.1,
?Common options for source drivers?.

                                        Declaration:
                                        file(filename);


Example 3.5. Using the file() driver

                                                source s_file { file("/proc/kmsg" log_prefix("kernel: ")); };


Note

On Linux, the klogd daemon can be used in addition to syslog-ng to read kernel
messages and forward them to syslog-ng. klogd used to preprocess kernel
messages to resolve symbols etc., but as this is deprecated by ksymoops there
is really no point in running both klogd and syslog-ng in parallel. Also note
that running two processes reading /proc/kmsg at the same time might result in
dead-locks.

1.5. pipe()

The pipe driver opens a named pipe with the specified name and listens for
messages. It is used as the native message delivery protocol on HP-UX.

The pipe driver has a single required parameter, specifying the filename of the
pipe to open. It has only the common source specific options as specified in
Table 3.1, ?Common options for source drivers?.

Pipe is very similar to the file() driver, but there are a few differences, for
example pipe() opens its argument in read-write mode, therefore it is not
recommended to be used on special files like /proc/kmsg.

Warning

It is not recommended to use pipe() on anything else than real pipes.

                                        Declaration:
                                        pipe(filename);


Note

You have to create this pipe using mkfifo(1).

Example 3.6. Using the pipe() driver

                                                source s_pipe { pipe("/dev/log" pad_size(2048)); };


1.6. sun-streams() driver

Solaris uses its STREAMS framework to send messages to the syslogd process.
syslog-ng has to be compiled with this driver enabled for sun-streams() to be
usable (see ./configure --help).

Newer versions of Solaris (2.5.1 and above), use a new IPC in addition to
STREAMS, called door to confirm the delivery of a message. syslog-ng supports
this new IPC mechanism via the door() option (see below).

The sun-streams() driver has a single required argument specifying the STREAMS
device to open, and the door() option.

Example 3.7. Using the sun-streams() driver

                                                source s_stream { sun-streams("/dev/log" door("/etc/.syslog_door"); };

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

2. Destination drivers

Destination drivers output log messages to somewhere outside syslog-ng: a file
or a network socket.

Some of the parameters affecting message formatting and sending are common for
all destinations.

Table 3.5. Common options for destination drivers

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Note

The usertty destination does not support templates.

2.1. file()

The file driver is one of the most important destination drivers in syslog-ng.
It allows to output messages to the specified file, or to a set of files.

The destination filename may include macros which get expanded when the message
is written, thus a simple file() driver may crete several files. For more
information on available macros see Section 4, ?Macros?.

If the expanded filename refers to a directory which does not exist, it will be
created depending on the create_dirs() setting (both global and a per
destination option).

Warning

Since the state of each created file must be tracked by syslog-ng, it consumes
some memory for each file. If no new messages are written to a file within 60
seconds (controlled by the time_reap global option), it is closed, and its
state is freed.

Exploiting this, a DoS attack can be mounted against the system. If the number
of possible destination files and its needed memory is more than the amount
available on the logserver.

The most suspicious macro is $PROGRAM, where the number of possible variations
is quite high, so in untrusted environments $PROGRAM should not be used.

Apart from the common destination options described in Table 3.5, ?Common
options for destination drivers? the file() destination has the following
options:

Example 3.8. Using the file() driver

                                                destination d_file { file("/var/log/messages" ); };


Example 3.9. Using the file() driver with macros in the file name and a
template for the message

                                                destination d_file {
                                                file("/var/log/$YEAR.$MONTH.$DAY/messages"

                                                };


2.2. pipe()

This driver sends messages to a named pipe like /dev/xconsole.

The pipe driver has a single required parameter, specifying the filename of the
pipe to open.

                                        Declaration:
                                        pipe(filename);


Note

You have to create this pipe using mkfifo(1).

Apart from the common destination options described in Table 3.5, ?Common
options for destination drivers? the pipe() destination has the following
options:

|               |      |to the SQL server.                      |             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Example 3.10. Using the pipe() driver

                                                destination d_pipe { pipe("/dev/xconsole"); };


2.3. unix-stream() & unix-dgram()

This driver sends messages to a unix socket in either SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM
mode.

Both drivers have a single required argument specifying the name of the socket
to connect to.

                                        Declaration:
                                        unix-stream(filename [options]);
                                        unix-dgram(filename [options]);


Apart from the common destination options described in Table 3.5, ?Common
options for destination drivers? the unix-stream() and unix-dgram()
destinations has the following options:

Table 3.8. Available options for unix-stream() and unix-dgram()

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|    Name    | Type |Default|                   Description                   |

|------------+------+-------+-------------------------------------------------|
|so_sndbuf   |number|0      |Specifies the size of the socket send buffer in  |
|            |      |       |bytes.                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Example 3.11. Using the unix-stream() driver

                                                destination d_unix_stream { unix-stream("/var/run/logs"); };


2.4. udp(), udp6(), tcp() and tcp6()

This driver sends messages to another host on the local intranet or internet
using either UDP or TCP protocol. The tcp6() and udp6() drivers use the IPv6
network protocol.

Both drivers have a single required argument specifying the destination host
address, where messages should be sent, and several optional parameters. Note
that this differs from source drivers, where local bind address is implied, and
none of the parameters are required.

udp() and udp6() automatically send multicast packets if a multicast
destination address is specified. tcp() and tcp6() do not support multicasting.

                                        Declaration:
                                        tcp(host [options]);
                                        udp(host [options]);
                                        tcp6(host [options]);
                                        udp6(host [options]);


Apart from the common destination options described in Table 3.5, ?Common
options for destination drivers? these destinations have the following options:

Table 3.9. Available options for udp(), udp6(), tcp() and tcp6()

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

|            |      |syslog-ng generates UDP packets    |                     |
|            |      |with the source IP address matching|                     |
|            |      |the original sender of the message.|                     |
|            |      |It is useful when you want to      |                     |
|            |      |perform some kind of preprocessing |                     |

|            |      |only works for UDP destinations    |                     |
|            |      |though the original message can be |                     |
|            |      |received by TCP as well. This      |                     |
|            |      |option is only available if        |                     |
|            |      |syslog-ng was compiled using the   |                     |

Example 3.12. Using the tcp() driver

                                                destination d_tcp { tcp("10.1.2.3" port(1999); localport(999)); };


2.5. usertty()

This driver writes messages to the terminal of a logged-in user.

The usertty() driver has a single required argument, specifying a username who
should receive a copy of matching messages.

                                        Declaration:
                                        usertty(username);


usertty() has only the common destination options described in Table 3.5,
?Common options for destination drivers?.

Note

The usertty() destination does not support templates.

Example 3.13. Using the usertty() driver

                                                destination d_usertty { usertty("root"); };


2.6. program()

This driver executes the specified program with the specified arguments and
sends messages to the standard input (stdin) of the child.

The program() driver has a single required parameter, specifying a program name
to start. The program is executed with the help of the current shell, so the
command may include both file patterns and I/O redirection, they will be
processed.

                                        Declaration:
                                        program(commandtorun);


Note

Syslog-ng 1.6 executed the program once at startup, and kept it running until
SIGHUP or exit. The reason was to prevent starting up a large number of
programs for messages, which would have enabled an easy DoS attack.

Syslog-ng 2.0 on the other hand restarts the program if it exits, mainly for
reliability reasons. However it is not recommended to launch programs for
single messages as that might easily cause a DoS for the system.

The program destination supports all common destination options described in
Table 3.5, ?Common options for destination drivers?. The default message format
that is sent to the program matches the BSD syslog protocol, e.g. it includes
the priority value in addition to the format used in logfiles.

Example 3.14. Using the program() destination driver

                                                destination d_prg { program("/bin/cat >/dev/null"); };


3. Filter functions

The following functions may be used in the filter statement, as described in
Section 2, ?Filters?.

4. Macros

Certain parts of syslog-ng (e.g.: destination filenames and message content
templates) can refer to one or more macros, which get expanded as a message is
processed. The table below summarizes the macros available in syslog-ng.

Macros can be included by prefixing the macro name with a $ sign, just like in
Bourne compatible shells. syslog-ng 2.0 uses a new syntax for braces around
macro names: "$MSG" and "${MSG}" are equivalent.

The macros related to the time of the message (e.g.: ISODATE, HOUR, etc.) have
two further versions each: one with the S_ and one with the R_ prefix (e.g.:
S_DATE and R_DATE ). The S_DATE macro represents the date found in the log
message, i.e. when the message was sent by the original application. R_DATE is
the date when syslog has received the message. DATE equals either S_DATE or
R_DATE, depending on the global option set in the now deprecated use_time_recvd
() parameter (see Section 5, ?Options?).

|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
|FACILITY     |The name of the facility from where the message originates.    |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|

|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
|PRI          |The priority and facility encoded as a 2 or 3 digit decimal    |
|             |number as it is present in syslog messages.                    |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
|             |Date of the message using the BSD-syslog style timestamp format|
|DATE, R_DATE,|(month/day/hour/minute/second, each expressed in two digits).  |
|S_DATE       |This is the original syslog time stamp without year            |
|             |information, e.g.: Jun 13 15:58:00.                            |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
|FULLDATE,    |A nonstandard format for the date of the message using the same|
|R_FULLDATE,  |format as DATE, but including the year as well, e.g.: 2006 Jun |
|S_FULLDATE   |13 15:58:00.                                                   |

|R_ISODATE,   |2006-06-13T15:58:00.123+01:00. If possible, it is recommended  |
|S_ISODATE    |to use ISODATE for timestamping. Note that syslog-ng can       |
|             |produce fractions of a second in the timestamp by using the    |
|             |frac_digits() global or per-destination option.                |

3. Setting output queue size
4. Setting the sync parameter

There are several settings available you can finetune the behaviour of
syslog-ng. The defaults should be adequate for a single server or workstation
installation, but for a central loghost receiving the logs from multiple
computers it may not be enough.

1. Setting garbage collector parameters

Syslog-ng 2.0 is a complete reimplementation of syslog-ng 1.6, and does not use
the mark and sweep garbage collector at all. The garbage collector parameters (
gc_idle_threshold, gc_busy_threshold) are still accepted but are ignored.

2. Setting time_sleep()

When there are a lot of parallel connections to syslog-ng, the amount of time
required to prepare for a single poll loop iteration is significant. Since the
arrival of every single log message triggers a new iteration, the CPU usage of
syslog-ng might increase significantly even if the number of messages received
is otherwise low. The solution is to add a fixed latency to message processing
to wait some messages to arrive and to process them in blocks. This can be
accomplished by setting the time_sleep() to a non-zero value. It is not
recommended to increase it above 100ms, as that might skew timestamps, slow
syslog-ng, and cause messages to be dropped. An alternative solution is to
avoid tcp() and unix-stream() sources and use the DGRAM versions, udp() and
unix-dgram(), respectively.

The value of fetch_limit() and log_fifo_size() must also be sized accordingly
when time_sleep() is modified.

3. Setting output queue size

syslog-ng always reads its incoming log channels to prevent the running daemons
from blocking. This may result in lost messages if the output queue is full, it
is therefore important to set the output queue size (termed in number of
messages). The size of the output queue can be set either globally, or on a per
destination basis.

Note

This does not apply to syslog-ng 2.0 if the flow-control flag is enabled. See
Table 2.4, ?Log statement flags? for details.

                        options { log_fifo_size(1000); };


or

                                destination d_messages { file("/var/log/messages" log_fifo_size(1000)); };


You should set your fifo size to the estimated number of messages in a message
burst. If bursts extend the bandwidth of your destination pipe, syslog-ng can
feed messages into the destination pipe after the burst has collapsed.

Of course syslog-ng cannot widen the network bandwidth, so if the destination
host lives on a noisy network and the logtraffic extends the bandwidth of this
network, syslog-ng cannot do anything. However, it will do its best.

4. Setting the sync parameter

The sync parameter does not exactly do what its name implies. As you have seen
messages to be sent are buffered in an output queue. The sync parameter
specifies the number of messages held in this buffer before anything is
written.

Note that it does not write all buffered messages into a single chunk; each
distinct message is written with a single write() system call.
